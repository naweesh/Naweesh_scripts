Scripts to automate work tasks
These scripts to make my daily work tasks more automated or tools for colleagues to rid of some tedious manual tasks


The largest script is M file Probe it is ~850 lines of Powershell i wrote.
The script STReceiver Transformer is notable as it is my first script that i used an SQL adaptor and parsed to an gridview that can be modified on the fly.
The script Tracktrace_scraper is the most used script for myself as it webscrapes our internal site.
The script Audit_Corrupted_Files is also notable for the process.
