# Naweesh_scripts

This page is to show some of the work that i have worked on, albeit due to sensitivites i cannot show the most meaningful work of creating and designing an EDW that comprised of an enterprise data repository for staging and an operational data store for reporting. 

Nor could i show logical data models, data migrations via SSIS, full data migration using TSQL (didnt have the luxury of SSIS however it would of ended up easier on tsql due to so many conditons) and SSRS reporting. 

But i do recommend to look at the Database Refresh scripts, i have four included (left 5 out due all the manual references) that are generic but shows alot of logic. Likewise i have the fragmentation script that shows some DBA prowess, however i see myself more of an datawarehouse developer. 

I also have some PowerShell scripts from earlier in my career (in particular check out STReceiver Transformer, its 850 lines of powershell), however i don't touch much powershell nowdays so i am far more rusty. I also do dabble a little in C# but couldn't share such code openly.
